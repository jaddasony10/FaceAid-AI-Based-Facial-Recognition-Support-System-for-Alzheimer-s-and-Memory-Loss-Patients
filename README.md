FaceAid: AI-Based Facial Recognition Support System for Alzheimer’s and Memory-Loss Patients
Description: FaceAid is a web-based healthcare application developed to assist Alzheimer’s patients and their caregivers. It provides interactive memory exercises, puzzles, and reminders designed to keep patients mentally active and engaged, helping to slow down cognitive decline.
The system is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with features like user authentication, daily task scheduling, and caregiver dashboards. Its user-friendly interface ensures that elderly users can easily navigate and perform activities. Caregivers can monitor participation, track progress, and manage reminders for medication or daily exercises.
In the future, FaceAid aims to integrate AI-driven personalization and facial recognition technology to identify patients automatically and recommend customized cognitive activities.
